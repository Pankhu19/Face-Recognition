# Face-Recognition
The Face Recognition System with Liveness Detection for Transaction and OTP provides an innovative solution to enhance the security of transactions through facial recognition, liveness detection, and OTP verification. It offers a reliable and user-friendly approach to ensure secure and authenticated transactions, making it suitable for various applications in banking, e-commerce, and other industries requiring robust identity verification.
## Key Features
* __Face Recognition__: The system uses facial recognition algorithms to identify and authenticate users based on their facial features.<br>
* __Liveness Detection__: Advanced liveness detection techniques, such as detecting eye blinking or texture computance, are employed to prevent spoofing attacks using static images or videos.<br>
* __Transaction Security__: The system integrates with transaction processes, requiring users to authenticate themselves through face recognition and liveness detection before completing a transaction.<br>
* __One-Time Password (OTP) Generation__: In addition to face recognition, the system generates one-time passwords (OTP) for an additional layer of security during log in.<br>
* __OTP Verification__: Users are prompted to enter the OTP generated by the system to validate their identity before proceeding with the transaction.<br>
* __Database Integration__: User information, including facial data and OTP, is securely stored and retrieved from a database to facilitate the authentication process.<br>
* __User Management__: The system allows for user registration, checking transaction history and viewing current account information.<br>
* __Logging and Audit Trail__: Transaction details, including user information, timestamp, and transaction status, are logged for audit purposes and system monitoring.<br>
* __User-Friendly Interface__: The system provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for seamless interaction and navigation.<br>
## Benefits
* __Enhanced Security__: The combination of face recognition, liveness detection, and OTP verification significantly improves the security of transactions, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and fraud.<br>
* __Reliable Identity Verification__: The use of advanced facial recognition technology ensures accurate and reliable identity verification, reducing the chances of impersonation or unauthorized access.<br>
* __Customizable__: The system can be customized to meet specific business requirements and integration needs.<br>
* __Comprehensive Transaction Monitoring__: The logging and audit trail functionality enable monitoring and tracking of transaction activities, providing a comprehensive overview of user actions and system performance.<br>
